Linux Users:
This application requires access to WiFi system files. You have two options:

1. Run the application with sudo privileges:
   sudo ./wlanReportGUI

2. Add your user to the 'netdev' group (recommended):
   sudo usermod -a -G netdev $USER
   
After adding yourself to the netdev group, you'll need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
